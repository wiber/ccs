# ADR-003: Learning Engine Design

## Status
In Progress

## Context
CCS needs to improve its operations over time based on usage patterns, performance metrics, and user feedback. The Learning Engine is central to our recursive self-improvement philosophy.

## Current Design
```javascript
class LearningEngine {
  // Tracks operation execution patterns
  trackExecution(operation, metrics);
  
  // Identifies optimization opportunities
  findPatterns(executionHistory);
  
  // Applies learned optimizations
  optimize(operation);
}
```

## Learning Strategies Implemented
1. **Frequency Analysis**: Common operations get priority optimization
2. **Performance Regression**: Detects when operations slow down
3. **Pattern Mining**: Finds common sequences of operations
4. **User Feedback Loop**: Incorporates ratings and comments

## Metrics Collected
- Execution time per operation
- Memory usage patterns
- Error frequencies and types
- User satisfaction scores
- Context size and complexity

## Questions for Contributors
- Which learning approach would best suit CCS's goals?
- How do we prevent overfitting to specific user patterns?
- Should learning be local-only or shared across installations?
- What's the right balance between exploration and exploitation?
