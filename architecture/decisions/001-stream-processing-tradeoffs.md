# ADR-001: Stream Processing Tradeoffs

## Status
Under Review

## Context
CCS processes large volumes of log data in real-time. We need to balance memory efficiency, processing speed, and code complexity.

## Decision
We implemented a circular buffer approach with the following characteristics:
- Fixed-size buffers (10,000 entries) to prevent unbounded growth
- Deduplication using a modified Bloom filter
- Batch processing in 1,000 entry chunks

## Consequences

### Positive
- Memory usage remains constant under load
- 10x performance improvement over naive implementation
- Predictable latency characteristics

### Negative
- Potential data loss when buffers overflow
- Bloom filter false positives affect deduplication accuracy
- CPU cache misses due to circular access patterns

## Open Questions
The current implementation achieves 5-10ms per entry processing time. However, several optimization opportunities remain:

1. **Memory Access Patterns**: The circular buffer causes cache misses. Would a ring buffer with power-of-2 sizing improve cache locality?

2. **Deduplication Strategy**: The Bloom filter uses k=3 hash functions. Is this optimal for our false positive tolerance?

3. **Batch Size Tuning**: We process 1,000 entries at a time. How does this interact with Node.js event loop timing?

4. **Alternative Approaches**: 
   - Would a lock-free queue improve concurrent access?
   - Could we use SIMD instructions for pattern matching?
   - Is there a better tradeoff between space and time complexity?

**What would you choose?**
