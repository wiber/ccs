**Problem**: No confidence in changes
**Fix**: Add comprehensive test suite
**Difficulty**: Medium
**Impact**: Safer development

---

## üîÑ Recursive Systems Track

### Issue #16: Self-Bootstrap Doesn't Improve Itself
**File**: `operations/self-bootstrap.js`
**Problem**: Improves code but not its own operation
**Fix**: Make it recursively self-improving
**Difficulty**: Hard
**Impact**: True recursive improvement

### Issue #17: No Meta-Operations Framework
**File**: Missing `lib/meta/`
**Problem**: Can't create operations that create operations
**Fix**: Build meta-operation DSL
**Difficulty**: Hard
**Impact**: Exponential capability growth
